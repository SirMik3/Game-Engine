# Game-Engine

to implement in c++ game:

>  #include "movement.hpp"

then to calculate player movment:
initialize a variable (in this example it is x):

>  int x = 

then use the function movment:

> movment();

cheatsheet:

movment(axis, speed, time, position (on axis), angle);

all of these are neccessary and the only varibles you can use in this function
